#### Part 1 - Assigning an origin-owner
1. Assign one person to _fork_ the original repository. This will be the _origin-owner_.
2. The _origin-owner_ should add each of the group-members as a _contributor_ to the project.
3. Each group-member should then _clone_ the project from their _origin-owner_


#### Part 2 - Delegating your work load
* Delegate each member to work on an **individual file**.
    * If files are worked on by multiple members, there will be **ugly, nasty** [merge conflicts](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-merge-conflicts).

#### Part 3 - Pushing your changes
* As changes are made to an `.html` page, ensure that you are _pushing_ your changes.
	* _changes_ can be _pushed_ by executing the following commands.
		1. `git add .`
		2. `git commit -m 'update message'`
		3. `git push -u origin master` 

### Part 4 - Submit Assignment
* Submit the assignment by _pushing_ the changes you have made to the project.
* Execute the following commands from the _root directory_ of the project to _push_ changes to your repository.
    * `git add .`
    * `git commit -m 'finished assignment'`
    * `git push -u origin master`
